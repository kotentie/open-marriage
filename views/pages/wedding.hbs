        <p> Pretend you are about to attend a formal affair at the White House...and then totally erase that image from your mind. It's not what we are aiming for at all.  We want everyone to look as great as we already know you do, but also be comfortable and relaxed. 
        </p>

                    
<h2> Nuptial Philosophy </h2>
<p>
This isn't a wedding; it's a commitment ceremony.  Perhaps you wonder why.  Please understand that our decision has nothing to do with our feelings for each other or our plans for the future.  We are just as much in love and devoted to each other as anyone who chooses to tie the knot.  But marriage is problematic as a legal matter for our particular situation given Jake's ALS.  No reason to go into the details, but we've looked into all the angles and have come to the conclusion that being married would actually impose penalties on us and possibly foreclose certain opportunities.  It's obvious this shouldn't be the case, but it is.  (We have a lawyer in the family who can back us up.)  Perhaps one day we will find ourselves in a situation where it would make sense to tie a big beautiful matrimonial bow around our relationship.  If so, we might even have another party!
